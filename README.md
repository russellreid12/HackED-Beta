# HackED-Beta
Chess

This program is a chess board simulation that can be run in the terminal. The purpose was to practice our python programming skills, specifically in object oriented programming.
We implemented move validation for the rook, bishop, and queen pieces to check for legal moves, and also to check if its the correct players turn.
Due to time constraints we did not finish implementing move validation for the king and pawn.
In the future we plan on improving this by adding a visual user interface.

Running Instructions:
To run the program, download the file chess.py and run "python3 chess.py" in the directory of the file.
To move chess pieces, type the beginning and destination squares of the chess piece. e.g. "e2 e4" .
